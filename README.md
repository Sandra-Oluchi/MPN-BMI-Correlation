# MPN-BMI-Correlation
This project shows the R-script used for coding the correlation between the risk of obesity and likelihood of developing myeloproliferative neoplasm(a type of blood cancer)
A multinomial statistical model was used to understand the association between BMI and MPN.It also involved using a dagitty model to find out the casual inference pathway betweeen the exposure(BMI) and outcome(MPN).
The outcome of the model showed a link betweeen the different types of MPN particularly Essential thrombocythemia and BMI. It involved a hospital case-control study.
